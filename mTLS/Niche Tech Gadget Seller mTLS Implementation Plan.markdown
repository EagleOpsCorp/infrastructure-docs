# Niche Tech Gadget Seller: mTLS Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the implementation of a mutual TLS (mTLS) service mesh for the Niche Tech Gadget Seller’s Kubernetes-based e-commerce platform on Amazon EKS. The goal is to secure service-to-service communication, ensure audit compliance, and support growth.

## 2. Current Infrastructure
- **EKS Cluster**: Kubernetes 1.24, 6 t3.large nodes (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM), 3 AZs.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14, StatefulSet, primary + 1 replica, 400 GB EBS.
- **Microservices**: Product Catalog, Inventory, Order, Customer, Payment, Configuration, Recommendation, Analytics; 3–5 replicas each.
- **Issues**: Unencrypted gRPC/HTTP communication, manual security management, limited monitoring.

## 3. Objectives
- **Security**: Enforce mTLS for all service communication.
- **Automation**: Automate certificate issuance/renewal and secret management.
- **Compliance**: Pass security audits.
- **Observability**: Monitor mTLS health and performance.
- **Scalability**: Handle 5,000 peak API requests/day.
- **Cost**: ~$600/month.

## 4. Stage 1: Planning and Environment Setup
### 4.1 Requirement Analysis
- **Workload**:
  - Traffic: 1,000 requests/day, 5,000 peak.
  - Services: 8 microservices, 30–50 daily calls.
  - Latency: <10ms mTLS overhead, <100ms API response.
  - Uptime: 99.95%.
- **Goals**:
  - mTLS for all traffic.
  - Automated certificates/secrets.
  - Real-time monitoring.
- **Constraints**:
  - $600/month budget.
  - Small team (2 devs, 1 DevOps).
  - No downtime during peaks.

### 4.2 Infrastructure Setup
- **Cluster**:
  - Verify EKS 1.24 compatibility.
  - Add 1 t3.large node for service mesh.
- **Namespaces**:
  - `linkerd`: Linkerd control plane.
  - `cert-manager`: Certificate management.
  - `vault`: Secret storage.
  - `prod-app`: Application services.
- **Application**:
  - Deploy microservices in `prod-app`.
  - Verify functionality via tests.
- **Service Mesh**:
  - Install Linkerd CLI, plan control plane.
  - Enable proxy sidecar injection.
- **Certificates**:
  - Deploy cert-manager, configure ClusterIssuer.
- **Secrets**:
  - Deploy Vault, use AWS KMS/S3.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Prometheus/Grafana in `monitoring`.
  - CloudWatch for logs/alerts.
- **Security**:
  - RBAC for restricted access.
  - Secrets for initial configs.
  - Network policies planned.

## 5. Implementation Strategy
- **Method**: Deploy Linkerd, cert-manager, Vault in sandbox, enable mTLS.
- **Steps**:
  1. Install Linkerd control plane.
  2. Deploy cert-manager, configure mTLS certificates.
  3. Deploy Vault, store secrets.
  4. Inject Linkerd proxies into services.
  5. Test mTLS encryption and performance.
  6. Validate audit compliance.

## 6. Expected Outcomes
- **Security**: mTLS for all communication, audit-compliant.
- **Performance**: <10ms mTLS overhead.
- **Cost**: ~$521/month (EC2: $504, EBS: $0.80, S3: $1.15, CloudWatch: $15), ~$400 with Spot Instances.
- **Processes**:
  - Automated deployments/rollbacks.
  - Cluster Autoscaler/HPA.
  - Grafana dashboards.
- **Business Impact**:
  - Secure, trusted platform.
  - Supports growth/features.
  - Reduced security overhead.

## 7. Next Steps
- Deploy Linkerd/cert-manager/Vault.
- Test mTLS in sandbox.
- Roll out to production.
- Monitor and optimize.
