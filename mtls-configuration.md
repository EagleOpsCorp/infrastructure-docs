   - Configure an S3 bucket for Terraform state locking.
   - Provision AWS resources:
     - RDS for relational database needs
     - MQ for asynchronous messaging
     - ElastiCache for caching and performance improvement
   - Implement Velero for backup and restore capabilities.

2. **Key Components**:
   ```hcl
   # S3 bucket for Terraform state
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
     bucket = "mtls-service-mesh-tf-state"
   }
   
   # VPC Module
   module "vpc" {
     source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
     version = "~> 3.0"
     # Configuration details...
   }
   
   # EKS Module
   module "eks" {
     source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
     version = "~> 18.0"
     # Configuration details...
   }
   
   # AWS resources (RDS, MQ, ElastiCache)
   resource "aws_db_instance" "service_mesh_db" {
     # Configuration details...
   }
   
   resource "aws_mq_broker" "service_mesh_mq" {
     # Configuration details...
   }
   
   resource "aws_elasticache_cluster" "service_mesh_cache" {

     repo: https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
     chart: vault
     version: 0.23.0
     # Configuration details...
   
   ---
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: vault-init
     namespace: vault
   spec:
     # Vault initialization job details...
   ```

3. **Service Mesh Implementation**:
   - Install Linkerd as the service mesh solution.
   - Configure Linkerd with certificates from cert-manager.
   - Set up the control plane and visualization components.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1
   kind: HelmChart
   metadata:
     name: linkerd-crds
     namespace: kube-system
   spec:
     repo: https://helm.linkerd.io/stable
     chart: linkerd-crds
     version: 1.6.1
     # Configuration details...
   
   ---
   apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1
   kind: HelmChart
   metadata:
     name: linkerd-control-plane
     namespace: kube-system
   spec:
     repo: https://helm.linkerd.io/stable
     chart: linkerd-control-plane
     version: 1.6.1
     # Configuration details with certificate settings...
   ```

4. **Sample Application Deployment**:
   - Deploy a three-tier application (frontend, backend, database).
   - Enable Linkerd proxy injection for all application pods.
   - Configure ServiceProfiles and AuthorizationPolicies for mTLS enforcement.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: sample-app
     annotations:
       linkerd.io/inject: enabled
   
   ---
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: frontend
     namespace: sample-app
   spec:
     # Deployment details with Linkerd annotations...
   
   ---
   apiVersion: policy.linkerd.io/v1beta1
   kind: AuthorizationPolicy
   metadata:
     name: backend-auth
     namespace: sample-app
   spec:
     # mTLS policy configuration...
   ```

## Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy the mTLS service mesh solution:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/mtls-service-mesh.git
   cd mtls-service-mesh
   ```

2. **Apply Terraform Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Configure kubectl for EKS**:
   ```bash
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name mtls-service-mesh-eks --region us-east-1
   ```

4. **Run the Deployment Script**:
   ```bash
   cd ../scripts
   chmod +x deploy-test.sh
   ./deploy-test.sh
   ```

5. **Verify the Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -A
   linkerd check
   ```

6. **Run the Testing Script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x test-mtls.sh
   ./test-mtls.sh
   ```

## Testing and Validation

The solution includes comprehensive testing to validate the mTLS implementation:

1. **Proxy Injection Verification**:
   - Ensure all pods have Linkerd proxy sidecars injected.
   - Verify that the proxies are properly configured for mTLS.

2. **mTLS Traffic Validation**:
   - Check that all service-to-service communication is secured with mTLS.
   - Verify encryption using Linkerd's visualization tools.

3. **Policy Enforcement Testing**:
   - Test that unauthorized access is properly blocked.
   - Verify that services with valid certificates can communicate.

4. **Certificate Validation**:
   - Ensure certificates are properly issued and valid.
   - Check certificate rotation and renewal.

5. **Service Communication Testing**:
   - Test end-to-end communication between frontend, backend, and database services.
   - Verify that the application functions correctly with mTLS enabled.

Example testing commands:
```bash
# Check Linkerd health
linkerd check

# View mTLS status between services
linkerd viz stat deploy -n sample-app

# Check service mesh traffic
linkerd viz edges deployment -n sample-app

# Test service-to-service communication
kubectl exec -it deploy/frontend -n sample-app -c frontend -- curl -s http://backend.sample-app.svc.cluster.local:80/api
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Certificate Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Services fail to communicate with TLS errors.
   - **Solution**: Check cert-manager logs and certificate status.
   ```bash
   kubectl get certificates -A
   kubectl describe certificate linkerd-identity-issuer -n cert-manager
   ```

2. **Proxy Injection Problems**:
   - **Symptom**: Pods don't have Linkerd proxies.
   - **Solution**: Verify namespace and pod annotations.
   ```bash
   kubectl get ns sample-app -o yaml | grep linkerd
   kubectl get deployment frontend -n sample-app -o yaml | grep linkerd
   ```

3. **Authorization Failures**:
   - **Symptom**: Services receive 403 errors despite mTLS.
   - **Solution**: Check AuthorizationPolicy resources.
   ```bash
   kubectl get authorizationpolicy -n sample-app
   kubectl describe authorizationpolicy backend-auth -n sample-app
   ```

4. **Vault Integration Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Secrets aren't properly available.
   - **Solution**: Check Vault status and initialization.
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault status
   kubectl logs job/vault-init -n vault
   ```

## Security Considerations

This implementation follows security best practices:

1. **Zero-Trust Security Model**:
   - All services must authenticate with valid certificates.
   - No service is trusted by default.

2. **Defense-in-Depth**:
   - Multiple security layers: VPC isolation, Kubernetes RBAC, mTLS, authorization policies.
   - Secrets are managed securely with Vault.

3. **Certificate Management**:
   - Automated issuance and rotation of certificates.
   - Short-lived certificates to minimize the risk of compromise.

4. **Policy Enforcement**:
   - Fine-grained access control with AuthorizationPolicies.
   - Service-to-service authentication requirements.

5. **Observability and Audit**:
   - Comprehensive logging and monitoring.
   - Visualization of all service mesh traffic.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future stages:

1. **Development Environment Deployment**:
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
   - Set up ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployment.
   - Create Helmfiles for consistent deployment.

2. **Staging and Production Deployment**:
   - Configure environment-specific settings.
   - Implement progressive deployment strategies.
   - Set up integration and smoke tests.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Tune Linkerd proxy settings for improved performance.
   - Optimize certificate rotation schedules.
   - Implement caching strategies for authentication.

4. **Additional Security Features**:
   - Implement network policies for additional traffic control.
   - Set up automated vulnerability scanning.
